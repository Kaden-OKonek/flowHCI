# Flow

This project is a homage to the [Flow Free game](https://www.bigduckgames.com/flowfree) developed by Big Duck Games. The game allows you to play pre-configured levels, create your own grids or even play totally random grids!

Take a look at the [docs](/docs/main.pdf) for more information about the project.

## Specifications üìã

The game is developed for computers with a minimum screen resolution of 1024x768. It is developed in Python 3.10 using the PyGame library.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* Python 3.10
* PyGame 2.1.2

## Installation üîß

### Windows

The steps are to be executed in the PowerShell.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amoralesc/flow.git
cd flow
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
venv/Scripts/activate
```

If the above step fails, you may need to active the script execution policy:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

4. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux and MacOS

The steps are to be executed in the terminal.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amoralesc/flow.git
cd flow
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game üöÄ

Before running the game, let's first take a look on how the grid is configured. A grid configuration is a JSON file that contains the initial state of the grid. For example, the grid configuration of the above screenshot is the following:

```json
{
  "rows": 5,
  "cols": 5,
  "qpoints": 5,
  "points": [
    [
      [0, 0],
      [4, 1]
    ],
    [
      [0, 2],
      [3, 1]
    ],
    [
      [0, 4],
      [3, 3]
    ],
    [
      [1, 2],
      [4, 2]
    ],
    [
      [1, 4],
      [4, 3]
    ]
  ]
}
```

Take a look at the available run options by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py -h
```

### Levels

There are currently [25 levels](/data/levels.json) pre-configured. These levels guarantee that there is always an unique solution to the grid.

Take a peek at the levels

```bash
cat data/levels.json
```

To play a level, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py -l LEVEL
```

where `LEVEL` is the level number (1-indexed position in the levels file).

### Grids from files

You can also define your own grid configuration file. An example is provided [here](/data/grid1.json). Fair warning: the game does not check if the grid is solvable.

To play a grid from a file, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py -f FILE
```

where `FILE` is the path to the grid configuration file.

### Random grids

You may also play a totally random grid. The grid will be generated by the game but it is not guaranteed that there is a solution to the grid.

To play a random grid, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py -r ROWS COLS QPOINTS
```

where `ROWS` is the number of rows, `COLS` is the number of columns and `QPOINTS` is the number of points in the grid.
